Introduction:
1. C++ is a general-purpose language
2. C++ is a middle-level programming language
3. C++ Procedure oriented, Object-oriented and Generic-oriented programming language.
4. C++ is a Cross-Platform programming language used to create High Performance Applications.
5. Most Used in operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.


1. C++ is a general-purpose language:
In computer software, a general-purpose programming language is a programming language designed to be used for writing software in the widest variety of application domains (a general-purpose language).A general-purpose programming language has this status because it does not include language constructs designed to be used within a specific application domain.
Conversely, a domain-specific programming language is one designed to be used within a specific application domain. Examples include page description languages and database query languages.

2. C++ is a middle-level programming language:
Medium-level language (MLL) is a computer programming language that interacts with the abstraction layer of a computer system.Medium-level language serves as the bridge between the raw hardware and programming layer of a computer system.
Although C++ is used in many industries and can be used to write almost anything, it particularly excels in delivering performance and using system resources efficiently.The control C++ gives the user over system resources enables a skilled coder to write a program that is quicker and more powerful than a similar program written in another programming language.

3. C++ Procedure oriented, Object-oriented and Generic-oriented programming language:
Procedure oriented- 

C++ literally means â€˜increment C by 1.
